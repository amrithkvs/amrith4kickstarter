			 		As a designer with a background in business economics, I have always been passionate about experiences that marry entrepenurship and technology. Through design, I hope to one day make the experience of crowdfunding more accessible and enjoyable. </p>

			 		<p class="lead">
					However, upon downloading the Kickstarter app, I was mildly disappointed. What was meant to be the service to convert everyone in the world to enjoy participating in crowdfunding campaigns is going through puberty — a phrase which here means steadily maturing yet unattractive compared to the adults in the game (aka change.org). </p>

					<p class="lead">
						<mark> …but as soon as I came to this realization, I became inspired to embark on what became a month long journey to the holy grail — the iOS app that Kickstarter deserves.</mark> </p>

					<p class="lead">
					To better understand Kickstarter, I took a trip down memory lane and revisited its inception. The original Kickstarter app for iPhone felt almost like Instagram or Vine, with a long vertical river of upcoming projects. That’s a great approach if people use your service only chronologically, but Kickstarter patrons navigate the site in a number of ways: by category, by popularity, by close date, and even randomly. </p>

						The new app design had a few advantages over the old version. For one, it was a much more distinctive-looking app. The entire UI was not only swipe-based, but consistent in orientation no matter where you were in Kickstarter’s navigation hierarchy (i.e. a swipe left or right always brings you to the next Kickstarter project, no matter where you are).

					<p class="lead">
						Treating the toolbar as a mechanism to discover new categories is an approach that makes sense given Kickstarters website information architecture. However, the way that users need to currently navigate to categories feels very tacked on. I found that users weren’t comfortable with reaching out to control the page from solely the top section. This led to an uncomfortable thumb position which over time served as a deterrent to switch categories.
				</div>

				<div class="article-post">

				
					<p class="lead">
						If Kickstarter wants to expand to the project backers side of the spectrum, they have to do it in a way that brings their existing user base along. This means creating a category discovery experience centered around ease of navigation and clarity. <b>Enter… updated navigation</b>

						<h4 class="posttitle"> Updated Navigation</h4>
					</div>

				<div class="article-post">



				
					<p class="lead">
						My updated navigation is a new experience made to bridge the gap between Backers and Contributors, replacing the current “top toolbar dropdown”. It was born out of the understanding that users who are picky about how they decide what category to select and what displays on their discover feed. 
						
				</div>

				<div class="article-post">



				
					<p class="lead">
						The scrollable bar under the toolbar was also not gesture friendly for users. According to Apple Design Guidlines, it is not recommended to add a top navigation and bottom in the same screen. Kickstarter however has three navigation channels on the same page which just leads to a cluttered page that ultimately leaves the users experience confusing.
						
				</div>

				<div class="article-post">
				
					<p class="lead">
						<mark> A better experience would be presenting the categories as a whole new tab in the bottom navigation - which gives the user just enough flexibility to easily navigate to and decide the categories of their liking without stretching their thumb. The homepage was also redesigned to showcase the larger typography by segregating the page into 4 sections which were originally on the scrollable bar on the top.</p> </mark>

						After looking at different options, I finally settled on bringing the profile and inbox right at the top of the homepage.

						I have come to understand that, through a more user friendly bottom navigation, the user is able to establish an immediate connection to the projects they discover. In addition, the inbox moving to the front has the potential to provide the user a chance to interact with others all the while making it more user friendly for project campaigners. Eventually allowing the app to evolve and grow with the user.</p>

After some user research and studying competitor models, I devised a unique user flow for the campaign setup wizard. </p>
